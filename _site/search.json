    "text": "Spider graph showing which components of the benthic invertebrate community are outside of reference conditions\n\n\n\nThe Aquatic Ecosystem Assessment (AEA) Tool was developed in 2016. It provides an interactive dashboard and simplifies the complicated steps in performing aquatic ecosystem assessments using the reference condition approach (RCA). Users supply a table of benthic invertebrate community data, as well as relevant habitat data. The dashboard then calculated a wide array of summary metrics from the community data and provides a variety of visualization and transformation methods. If collection areas are identified as reference or exposed, a RCA can be performed using the Test Site Analysis (TSA) and Nearest-Neighbour site matching (NN). This dashboard provides many options for how these analysis can be performed, or provides heuristic algorithms for identifying suitable defaults. The final results are summarized using a series of informative graphics, ideal for visual story telling on the conditions of the aquatic community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNearest Neighbour Site Matching Dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Site Analysis Result Dashboard"

    "text": "Tracey Saxby, Integration and Application Network (ian.umces.edu/media-library)\n\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to use data from Ontario’s Aquatic Ecosystem Classification (AEC) together with Flowing Waters Information System (FWIS) to develop predictive models of fish communities across Ontario. The biomass and density of 12 fish taxa are modeled using AEC variables, as well as landcover summaries from the Ontario Landcover Compilation (OLC). Landcover types were summarized into different groups, as well as a Landscape Disturbance Index (LDI), which quantifies the potential impacts of different landcover types to aquatic ecosystems. Predictions of current populations are available across all tributaries to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River.\nThis work is still ongoing, but preliminary results are available in an interactive dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved Brook Trout Density\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredicted Brook Trout Density"

    "text": "The ihydro R package was developed by EcoPulse in 2022 as a tool to simplify and standardize the complex calculation steps required for summarizing landscape information in a context relevant to aquatic ecosystems.\nAquatic environmental scientists are often interested in relating landscape features to observed responses (fish size, water temperature, invertebrate community composition, etc.) in streams, rivers and lakes. The computational workflow for conducting these investigations is complex. Simply describing how water flows and accumulates across the landscape can be a challenge itself, but for aquatic scientists it is only the first step. The stream network must then be extracted from the landscape, and reaches (a.k.a. segments; i.e., stretches of river between two confluences) identified and given unique identifiers. These reaches must then be attributed to be informative (slope, stream order, upstream channel length, amount of upstream tree-cover, etc.); and upstream-downstream connectivity between reaches established.\nThe complexity of this workflow can be a rate limiting step in the scope, content, quality, replicability, and applicability of investigations by aquatic environmental scientists. This tool was used extensively in the development of the Ontario fish models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraced Flow Paths\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted Landscape Predictors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Landscape Predictions"
