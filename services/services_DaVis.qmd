### Comprehensive analysis of environmental data to identify trends and gain insights

-   Sufficiency and power analysis to determine the strengths and limitations of a data set
-   Statistical analysis of water quality data to monitor pollutants
-   Trend analysis to detect changes in invertebrate communities over time
-   State of the resource reporting to quantify the health of a watershed

### Analysis are supported by clear and informative visual representations of data

-   Maps when spatial representation matters in the data
-   Distributions when you have lots and lots of data points and want to study where and how the data points are distributed
-   Correlations identify relationships among multiple variables
-   Rankings compare the position or performance of multiple items with respect to each other
