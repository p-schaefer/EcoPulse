Co-lead a workshop in 2017 at the Ontario Benthos Biomonitoring Network Semi-Annual Biomonitoring Meeting on use of generalized linear mixed-effects models for investigating trends in long-term benthic datasets. This workshop highlighted the strengths of mixed-effects models in analysis of routine monitoring data, while providing easy to follow example scripts for users to learn the complexities of these models. A github repository containing all the training material is available [here](https://github.com/p-schaefer/RWorkshop).
