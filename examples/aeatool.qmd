The [Aquatic Ecosystem Assessment (AEA) Tool](https://ecopulse.shinyapps.io/aeatool_dev/) was developed in 2016. It provides an interactive dashboard and simplifies the complicated steps in performing aquatic ecosystem assessments using the reference condition approach (RCA). Users supply a table of benthic invertebrate community data, as well as relevant habitat data. The dashboard then calculated a wide array of summary metrics from the community data and provides a variety of visualization and transformation methods. If collection areas are identified as reference or exposed, a RCA can be performed using the Test Site Analysis (TSA) and Nearest-Neighbour site matching (NN). This dashboard provides many options for how these analysis can be performed, or provides heuristic algorithms for identifying suitable defaults. The final results are summarized using a series of informative graphics, ideal for visual story telling on the conditions of the aquatic community.
